# Family Tree Management System
## System Design
### Problem
  On the planet of Lengaburu, the distant galaxy of Tara B. Our protagonists are King Arthur, Queen Margaret and their family. King Arthur is the emperor of Lengaburu and has been ruling the planet for the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu!). Letâ€™s write some code to get to know the family.
### Solution
#### Functional
1. Add Families: Users can add families with attribute name.
2. Add Family Members: Users can add family members with details such as name, birth date, gender, and other optional attributes.
3. Define Relationships: Users can establish relationships (e.g., parent, child, spouse, sibling) between family members.
4. View Family Tree: Display the family tree visually, allowing users to see relationships and family structure.
5. Edit Member Details: Update information about each family member (e.g., edit birth dates, add death dates, or modify relationships).
6. Import: Enable users to import family data from txt file and Allow users to search for specific family member relationships.
